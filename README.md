The Great Pyramid Puzzle was a puzzle made by Eliot Inventions Ltd. in 1981. I tried solving it way back then on my 
[ZX80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX80), but didn't make much progress, so nearly 40 years later I'm going to try again.

There's an excellent overview of the puzzle on [Jaap's Puzzle Page](https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyramid.htm) but I'll repeat a
few of the details here.

The puzzle consists of a regular tetrahedral body and 36 loose triangular tiles that are coloured with red and white patterns. 
Each tile has a peg in its centre which fits into holes on the tetrahedron. There are nine tiles on each face. The aim is to cover
the tetrahedron with the tiles such that all the adjacent tiles match along their common edge.

There was also a smaller version, called the Great Pyramid Pocket Puzzle, with 16 tiles and four tiles on each face.

The tiles are regular triangles which are split into 12 segments by six lines, the three bisectors and three lines parallel to the
sides. The four segments along each side are either red or white.
